# Given an array A of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N â€“ 1. All elements may not be present in the array. every element is unique except for the -1 and If the element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array. Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present, display -1 at that place.

# Examples:

# Input : arr = {-1, -1, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2, -1, 4, -1} Output : [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, 6, -1, -1, 9]

# Input : arr = {19, 7, 0, 3, 18, 15, 12, 6, 1, 8, 11, 10, 9, 5, 13, 16, 2, 14, 17, 4} Output : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

#   arr_length = arr.length
#   new_arry = []
#   (0...arr_length).each do |i|
#     if(arr[i] != i && arr.include?(i))
#       new_arry[i] = i
#     elsif(arr[i] != i && !arr.include?(i))
#       new_arry[i] = -1
#     else
#       new_arry << i
#     end
#   end
#   new_arry
